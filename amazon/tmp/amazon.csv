{"title": "Apple iPhone X (Silver, 256GB)", "ratings": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "reviews": "I am iPhone user from last 6 years. I have had iphonex since last 2 weeks. But over the call I have made. I have had everyone says my voice is very faint or they doesn\u2019t hear me at all. Is this software problem? I had discussion with online customer service representative and also at apple authorised service center and they did some diagnostic but it doesn\u2019t worked. Less than a week owning it is pretty disappointing after spending this huge amount. I tried with and without case too."}
